        <p>Bruce Lee was born in November of 1940 as a Hong Kong-American. He is famous for many things, such as his films and martial arts. Within his pedigree of martial arts, Bruce Lee founded Jeet Kune Do, which is credited as a sizable influence upon mixed martial arts.

Bruce Lee’s acting career starting early, as his father introduced him and arranged for several of his appearances as a child actor. He produced five martial art films in the early 1970s that brought a massive surge of interest from the west to the culture of the east.

His famously goofy and silly yellow jumpsuit debuted in The Game of Death which released 1978. In South China Morning Post’s Article, they interviewed film producer Andre Morgan, who was working closely with Lee on the set of Game of Death.

“There have always been a lot of stories going around, things like Bruce chose that colour to make some kind of statement about his race or his culture,” says Morgan. “The truth of the matter is far more simple, though, as is usually the case with these things.
<br><br>
“When Bruce came on to set for Game of Death, the wardrobe department produced two tracksuits to choose from – one yellow and one that was black,” Morgan said.
<br><br>
“Once we sat down and went through the script we came to the scene where he fights with Kareem [Abdul-Jabbar], who kicks him and leaves a dirty great big footprint on his chest. Of course if the suit was black, you’d never see the footprint, so we went with the yellow one. It was a wardrobe decision. Simple as that.”
