# Reflection

In this assignment you've learned very basic HTML and CSS, the content and presentation layers of the web. Take this opportunity to think about how they might relate to your work as a historian.

## Question 1 (150 words)
#### In Part 2, we explored the use of semantic elements such as `<header>`, `<article>`, and `<section>`. These elements make it easier for machines and non-visual browsers to navigate web pages. Why might this be important? (You might want to Google around a bit before answering!)

By more clearly defining each element of the webpage’s layout, it affords better support and functionality for tools that support the use cases of disabled individuals. Text to speech programs for example, could place different emphasis on different words to closer express the intent and meaning behind the words chosen by it’s author. Text to speech users could also be given finer granularity in their web browsing use, and could more specifically target elements within the header or the footer if they’re specifically interested in navigating the webpage.

Machines crawling text on a large amount of web pages would become more efficient in being able to directly skip header and footer elements that are usually of little worth. The addition of an article tag, for example, would massively improve Google’s web crawler and search results would be able to much more precisely target and bring forth the information we are seeking.


## Question 2 (150 words)
#### In your CSS work, you learned how to change the presentation of material on the web without changing the content. Using a pen and paper, a drawing program, or (if you're feeling ambitious) real HTML and CSS, mock up 2 very different presentations of the information you displayed in your post. Put images of them on the Internet somewhere (but not in this repository) and link to them here. Write a brief paragraph discussing the effect of the presentaiton layer on the reader.
